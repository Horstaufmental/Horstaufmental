## Controversies

The Ministry of Research has faced constant criticism regarding the scope of its classified programs, particularly within the **Strategic and Military Technologies** department. Critics argue that the ministry’s focus on results-driven research has led to insufficient oversight, especially in projects involving autonomous weapon systems, and long-term exposure to high-energy environments.

While the ministry maintains that all projects comply with Lunarian legal frameworks, the lack of transparency has fueled speculation of unregulated and inhumane experimentation.

The covert nature of the ministry’s collaborations with Earth-based institutions has been a recurring source of controversy. Critics within the Lunar Council have raised concerns that technology exchanges, particularly in nuclear and fusion-related fields, could destabilize geopolitical balances on Earth or expose Lunarian methods to reverse engineering.


Supporters argue that controlled collaboration serves as a testing ground for large scale systems without risking the Lunar infrastructure.
